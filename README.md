# stayCozy
A service that provides daily clothing recomendations based on the weather forecast to help you stay cozy throughout the day via SMS.

## How it works:

This service uses the Spring Framework to read the RESTful API provided by [MetaWeather](https://www.metaweather.com/api/) to retrieve the weather forecast at the user specified location, then it generates a clothing recomendation [using a guide from tommorow.io](https://www.tomorrow.io/weather/blog/weather-clothing-guide/). The service then uses Twillio to send this recomendation via SMS to the user every day at a specified time.

## Tools and Technologies used:
- Spring Framework
- Java
